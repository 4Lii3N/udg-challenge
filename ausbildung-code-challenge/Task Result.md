## Used technologies / Frameworks

I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

- JavaScript (NodeJS/ReactJS)/ jQuery

I chose jQuery because its usefull for changing static elements such as table rows in this case. And I chose Node/React because it provides alot of quality of life features while writing aswell as easy ways to install libraries and dependencies.

## Used 3rd Party Libraries

I use the following 3rd party libraries in my project: (if none, remove the table and explain why)

Name | Reason
--- | ---
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) | Simple RWD framework for designing the front end.
[PapaParse](https://www.papaparse.com) | quick and easy CSV parser.

## Installation / Run

The following components must be installed locally:

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) v13.2.0
- [reactjs](https://reactjs-bot.github.io/react/docs/installation.html) v18.1.0
